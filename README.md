## Development

We recommend using VSCode for development, you should be prompted to install recommended extensions when first opening the project.

We use Yarn for package management. All files are written in TypeScript.

Git Hooks are also used by means of Husky.

Commit messages are enforced with Commitizen.

Run the following commands to get started:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start server with hot reload for development
yarn dev

# Check for compilation errors & lint

# Compile to executable file & run
