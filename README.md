# Library API

An API for easily accessing information related to meetings and publications of Jehovah's Witnesses.

## Development

We recommend using VSCode for development, you should be prompted to install recommended extensions when first opening the project.

We use Yarn for package management. All files are written in TypeScript.

Git Hooks are also used by means of Husky.

Run the following commands to get started:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start server with hot reload for development
yarn dev

# Check for compilation errors & lint
yarn lint

# Run test suite
yarn test

# Compile to executable file & run
yarn build
yarn start
```
