# Library Media

![Library Media](./app/renderer/src/assets/logo-banner.png)

A cross-platform desktop application that simplifies showing media for meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses.

Finally, non-Windows users can now also display media in a more professional way.

This package is brought to you by [Library API](../../README.md).

## Download

TODO: Add download files to release assets

In the meantime you can package this yourself using the `build` and `package` commands in [Development](#Development).

## Usage

TODO: Documentation

## Development

Run the following commands to get started. If you are running from the root directory you can add `media` to run these (for example `yarn media dev` instead of just `yarn dev`):

```bash
# Start server with hot reload for development
yarn dev

# Build (outputs to /dist)
yarn build

# Package into an app (make sure to `yarn build` first)
yarn package

# Lint files
yarn lint

# Run test suite
yarn test

# Run Type Checking Service
yarn tsc
```
