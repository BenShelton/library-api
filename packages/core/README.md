Core tools for use with other Library API packages.

These can also be used to build your own app based on this API.

This package is brought to you by [Library API](../../README.md).

## Installing

Please note that core tools are built to run on a Node environment as it requires a filesystem to store downloaded files.

You can install with your preferred package manager:

```bash
# NPM
npm install @library-api/core

# Yarn
yarn add @library-api/core
```

## Usage

TODO: Documentation

## Development

Run the following commands to get started. If you are running from the root directory you can add `media` to run these (for example `yarn core build` instead of just `yarn build`):

```bash
# Build (outputs to /dist)
yarn build

# Lint files
yarn lint

# Run test suite
yarn test

# Run Type Checking Service
yarn tsc
```
